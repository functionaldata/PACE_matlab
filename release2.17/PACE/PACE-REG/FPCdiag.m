% ============
% Description:
% ============
% 
% This is the driver function to perform Functional Linear Regression (FLM),
% which includes functional regression diagnostics and a boostrap test for the overall
% significance of the functional regression, where the predictor is a
% function X(t_x) and the response can be either a function Y(t_y) or a scalar.
% Reference: [9]
% 
% This function includes the following steps:
% 
% 1) FPCA using the PACE method for X(t_x) and/or Y(t_y).
% 
% 2) Computation of the regression parameter function \beta.
% 
% 3) Prediction of response functions, given observations of predictor trajectories. 
% 
% 4) Computation of functional R-square and Quasi R-square (a simple predictive
%    measure based on the concept of variance explained by the regression).
%

%    H.G. (2007). Diagnostics for functional regression via residual
%    processes. Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 51, 4849-4863).
% 
% 6) Boostrap test for regression effect, for the null hypothesis
%    that the functional R-square equals zero (testing for overall functional
%    regression effect, as described in M\"uller, H.G., Chiou, J.M., Leng, X. (2008).

% Usage:
% ========
% 
% [res xx yy h d rej pv cb grid_x grid_y] = FPCdiag(x, t_x, y, t_y,...
%         param_X, param_Y, FIT, K_x, K_y, isNewSub, bootstrap, nsim, alpha)
% 
% =======
% Input:
% =======
% 
% x    :  1*n cell array for predictor function x, where x{i} is the row vector of
%         measurements for the ith subject, i=1,...,n. It contains those subjects
%         that are used for prediction, when "isNewSub" is defined as either
%         a vector of 0's and 1's or as a positive integer. Then, nn is the number
%         of subjects to be used for estimation and n-nn is the number of subjects
%         to be used for prediction. When "isNewSub" is set to [], all n subjects
%         are used for estimation and no prediction will be calculated.
% 
%         See "isNewSub".
% 
% t_x  :  1*n cell array, t_x{i} is the row vector of time points for the ith
%         subject at which the corresponding measurements x{i} are taken,
%         i=1,...,n. It contains subjects that are used for prediction.
%         See above for two different cases of "isNewSub" and the definition of
%         "isNewSub" for more details.
% 
% y    :  i) When no prediction is requested, that is, isNewSub = [] or
%            isNewSub = 0:
%            1*n cell array for the case of a response function y, where y{i} is the response
%            row vector for the ith subject, i = 1,...,n
%            or a 1*n vector in the case of a scalar response y, where y(i) is the response value
%            for the ith subject, i = 1,...,n.
% 
%        ii) When prediction is requested, that is isNewSub is either a vector of
%            0's and 1's or a positive integer, then it is a cell array of dim 1*nn or a vector
%            of dim 1*nn, where nn is the number of subjects used for estimation.
% 
%       iii) When prediction is requested and y is of dim 1*n, it will be
%            truncated to dim 1*nn, according to the isNewSub definition;
%            see "isNewSub" for more details.
% 
% t_y  :  1*n cell array, t_y{i} is the row vector of time points for the ith
%         subject on which corresponding measurements y{i} are taken,
%         i = 1,...,n, or [] if y is a scalar response.
%         See above for the two different options for "isNewSub", and the definition of
%         "isNewSub" for more details.
% 
% param_X: an object that is returned by setOptions() and defines the input
%         arguments for the FPCA() of the X (predictor) functions (for default, set param_X = []).
%         The default method of choosing the number of principal components
%         is 'FVE'. For the other defaults, see setOptions().
% 
% param_Y: an object that is returned by setOptions(), and defines the input
%          arguments for the FPCA() of the Y (response) functions (for default, set param_Y = []).
%          The default method of choosing the number of principal
%          components for the response trajectories is 'BIC1'. See setOptions() for more details.
%          When y is a scalar, this object will be ignored.
% 
% K_x:   positive integer, normally not needed. Number of principal components
%        of predictor x used for functional regression, must be smaller than or equal to the maximum
%        number of principal components available from FPCA. Default K_x = [], then
%        K_x is the number of components selected by FPCA.m for predictor functions.
% 
% K_y:   positive integer, normally not needed. This has no effect in the
%        the case of a scalar response. For functional response, it is the 
%        number of principal components for the response y
%        used for functional regression, and it must be smaller than or equal to the maximum
%        number of principal components available from FPCA. Default K_y = [].
%        
% 
%  FIT:    an indicator with values 0 or -1:
%             FIT =  0: Fitting a functional linear regression (default) through decomposition into
%                       simple linear regressions through the origin between the FPC scores of Y (responses)
%                       and those of X (predictors) (denoted as 'YPC' in the following).
%             FIT = -1: Prediction with a functional linear regression
%                       with a functional response Y, specifically adapted to the case of sparsely sampled response 
%                       trajectories and using a linear regression of observed responses Y on FPC scores of X, 
%                       applying weighted least squares with the covariance surface of Y as the
%                       weight matrix (denoted as 'YCO' in the following).
%             Note:   The option FIT = -1 aims at optimal
%                     prediction for sparsely observed functional responses (i.e. when 
%                     Y is sparse and functional), and does not target the regression parameter surface                     \beta. 
% 
% 
% isNewSub: i) 1*n vector of 0s or 1s, with elements:
% 
%              1   if the data for the corresponding subject, i.e.,
%                  x(isNewSub == 1), t_x(isNewSub==1), t_y(isNewSub == 1)
%                  are used for prediction;
% 
%                 There will be n-nn subjects with isNewSub = 1.
% 
%              0   if the data for the corresponding subject, i.e.,
%                  x(isNewSub == 0), t_x(isNewSub == 0), y and
%                  t_y(isNewSub == 0) are used for estimation.
% 
%                  There will be nn subjects with isNewSub = 0
% 
%              Note: This option is convenient to compute leave-one-out
%              prediction if desired.
% 
% 
%          ii) If this is a positive integer, say 5, then the last 5 subjects from the arrays x,
%              t_x, t_y are used for prediction. In other words, when choosing
%              this option, append the new subjects to the end of x, t_x and
%              t_y. Then the subjects with data in the first nn rows of arrays x, t_x,t_y and all y (of length nn)
%              are used for estimation and the subjects with data in the remaining rows of x,t_x and t_y (of length
%              n-nn) are used for prediction.
%              Example:  isNewSub = 5; n = length(x)
%                  x(1:(n-5)), t_x(1:(n-5)), y, t_y(1:(n-5)) are used for
%                  estimation, while x((n-4):n), t_x((n-4):n) and t_y((n-4):n) are used for
%                  prediction
%              This option is convenient to perform prediction for a large number of new subjects.
% 
%           iii) set isNewSub = [] for the default value, i.e., no prediction.
% 
%        Note:
% 
%        o   nn > n - nn, and should not be too small. In other words,
%            the number of subjects used for estimation should be larger than
%            the number of subjects used for prediction.
% 
%        o   When no prediction is requested, x, t_x, y, t_y all will be of
%            length of n = nn.
% 
%        o   When prediction is requested, x, t_x, t_y will be of length of n,
%            which includes nn subjects for estimation and n-nn subjects for
%            prediction. Here y is always of length nn (< n).
% 
%        o   When prediction is requested and y is of length n (> nn), a warning
%            message will be issued and y will be truncated to length nn. This
%            assumes that only nn among the n available data for y are used
%            for estimation and the remaining n-nn data will be ignored.
% 
% bootstrap: Bootstrap method.  If bootstrap = 'pre', confidence bands for beta and
%           R2test are based on bootstrapping by resampling from the original subject
%           data, which is more accurate but computationally intensive and thus very slow. The 
%           default [] bootstrap is based on resampling from the estimated functional 
%           principal scores. The variability coming from both measurement errors and errors 
%           in estimating mean and eigenfunctions is neglected in this variant, which is 
%           therefore less accurate, but much faster.
% 
%   nsim:   size of the bootstrap sample 
%              bootstrap = 'pre'  ==>  default is nsim = 200
%              bootstrap = 'post' ==>  default is nsim = 500 
% 
%   alpha:  level of hypothesis tests and confidence bands, optional; pointwise
%           100(1-alpha)% confidence bands will be created for the regression
%           parameter function/surface. The null hypothesis of no regression
%           relation is tested at level alpha, based on bootstrapping the
%           functonal R-square under the null hypothesis. The
%           default value for alpha is 0.05.
% 
% Details: i) There are no default values for the first 3 arguments, that
%             is, these data must be provided as part of the input arguments. 
%             Note t_y can be set to [] when y is a scalar response.
%         ii) Any unused or optional arguments can be set to "[]" to request
%             default values;
%        iii) FPCA() calls PCA(); setOptions() sets the input
%             arguments for PCA() and the returned object contains all
%             values returned by PCA();
%         iv) Names of objects can be retrieved through the names() function, i.e.,
%             names(xx), names(yy), names(res) and their actual values can be
%             retrieved through the getVal() function, example: getVal(res, 'BETA'),
%             getVal(res, 'newy') etc.
%         v) When isNewSub is set to be [], no prediction will be performed,
%            and the number of subjects in x is the same as the number of subjects
%            in y;
%            when isNewSub is either a vector of 0's and 1's or a positive
%            integer, then the number of subjects in x is larger than the number of subjects
%            of y, since the former contains new subjects for which no response data are used 
%            and prediction of responses is requested. Any such data will not be used in the 
%            model estimation process. By default, no prediction will be performed.
